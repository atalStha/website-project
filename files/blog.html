            <p style="font-size: 20px; color: #6c767a; ">Technology is a body of knowledge devoted to creating tools, processing actions and the extracting of materials. The term ‘Technology’ is wide, and everyone has their way of understanding its meaning. We use technology to accomplish various
                tasks in our daily lives, in brief; we can describe technology as products and processes used to simplify our daily lives. Technology is also an application of science used to solve problems. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size:20px; color: #6c767a;">Technology affects every aspect of our lives, we all use it every day with little thought. Many of us take technology for granted but the truth is that it would be hard for us without technology. Albert Einstein sums up what the technology
                we have created for ourselves has done to us in a single quote. “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity” (Einstein). There are numerous amounts of ways which has changed the lifestyle of people
                in some way no matter how small it is. The continuous advancement of technology has brought the people closer. Not only can people travel from one end of the world to another end in just a few days, but they can talk to one another instantly.
                The advancement in technology has also improved home entertainment and improved housing and industry which make life much easier and safer. The health industry has changed due to the technology which reduces the change of errors made by
                doctors. Technology has increased the job opportunities as well as taken them. As I am a student studying in this field, it means that the job opportunities have increased as advancement in technology.</p>
